# TCTrack: Temporal Contexts for Aerial Tracking




## Abstract
Temporal contexts among consecutive frames are far
from been fully utilized in existing visual trackers. In this work, we present TCTrack1, a comprehensive framework to fully exploit temporal contexts for aerial tracking. The temporal contexts are incorporated at two levels: the extraction of features and the refinement of similarity maps. Specifically, for feature extraction, an online temporally adaptive convolution is proposed to enhance the spatial features using temporal information, which is achieved by dynamically calibrating the convolution weights according to the previous frames. For similarity map refinement, we propose an adaptive temporal transformer, which first effectively encodes
temporal knowledge in a memory-efficient way, before
the temporal knowledge is decoded for accurate adjustment
of the similarity map. TCTrack is effective and efficient:
evaluation on four aerial tracking benchmarks shows
its impressive performance; real-world UAV tests show its
high speed of over 27 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier.

The implementation of our online temporally adaptive convolution is based on [TadaConv](https://github.com/alibaba-mmai-research/TAdaConv) ICLR2022.


## 1. Environment setup
This code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04, Python 3.8.3, Pytorch 0.7.0/1.6.0, CUDA 10.2.
Please install related libraries before running this code: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Test
Download [pretrained model](https://mega.nz/file/N0EiiLjB#59wv0Yeovl7KnrMRLTLx2tAKTjpdo6AwcCuXuMgObc4) and put it into `tools/snapshot` directory.

Download testing datasets and put them into `test_dataset` directory. 

```bash 
python test.py                                \
	--dataset UAV10fps                      \ # 
    --dataset_name
	--snapshot snapshot/general_model.pth  # tracker_name
```
The testing result will be saved in the `results/dataset_name/tracker_name` directory.
